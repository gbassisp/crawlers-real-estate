# crawlers-real-estate
A webcrawler project for real estate websites without an API

This project designed to build multiple spiders with different settings to crawl and gather real estate data through different very basic websites and some which do not make data available through an API nor allow scraping.

So far, the goal is to create spiders to feed some database for later analysis. Perhaps the initial data will be stored on a simple CSV system and lately will be directed to some decent DBMS.

There is a lot to be defined yet
